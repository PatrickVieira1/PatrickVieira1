Nice to meet you!

My name is Patrick Vieira and I love programming!

I first learned about Python while browsing Reddit and started reading "How to automate boring stuff with Python" during my lunch hours.
Back in my last job, I was working with Product Development Engineering and it had many boring and mundane tasks, such as opening a PDF file and retrieving an information.
After partial read from the book, I started my first project (which sadly I don't have anymore, Github was not something that I knew) which operated as following:

- Browse a list of PDFs files
- Collect every information as a string
- Retrieve a certain info with a regular expression
- write file name and this info in an Excel spreadsheet

Perhaps I spent too many hours trying to do this, but it was soooo satisfying once I managed to do that and everyone was mesmerized.

From then it was a lot of development and still is.

My next project involves creating a game for ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) which I'm proud to be part of.
